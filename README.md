## API Documentation





## procces
    User Sign-up Process:
        User fills out a sign-up form with their desired username and password.
        The form data is sent to the server.
        The server receives the sign-up request and validates the data.
        If the data is valid, the server creates a new user record in the database with the provided username and encrypted password.
        The server sends a response to the client indicating successful sign-up.

    User Sign-in Process:
        User fills out a sign-in form with their username and password.
        The form data is sent to the server.
        The server receives the sign-in request and extracts the username and password.
        The server verifies the provided username and password by comparing them with the stored user credentials in the database.
        If the credentials match, the server generates a token or session for the user to maintain their authenticated state.
        The server sends a response to the client indicating successful sign-in.

    Authentication Middleware:
        Incoming requests to protected routes are intercepted by the authentication middleware.
        The middleware checks for the presence of a valid authentication token or session in the request headers.
        If the authentication token or session is valid, the middleware allows the request to proceed to the protected route.
        If the authentication token or session is invalid or missing, the middleware sends an error response indicating unauthorized access.
